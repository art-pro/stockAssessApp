# Check Why Grok Is Failing

The stock data showing (444 USD) is likely OLD data in your database from before the recent changes.

## Steps to Diagnose:

1. **Check Backend Console Logs** - Look for these debug messages I added:
   - `Grok API request error:`
   - `Grok API returned status:`
   - `Grok API error response:`
   - `Grok raw response:`
   - `Failed to parse Grok response JSON:`
   - `Failed to parse Grok stock analysis:`

2. **Restart Backend** to see fresh logs:
```bash
cd /Users/jetbrains/GolandProjects/stock–backend
go run main.go
```

3. **Click the refresh icon** next to the ORCL stock (not "Update All Prices")

4. **Watch the backend console** - you'll see exactly where Grok is failing

## Common Issues:

1. **Invalid API Key** - Check your `.env` file has correct `XAI_API_KEY`
2. **API Rate Limit** - Grok may be rate limiting your requests
3. **API Response Format Changed** - Grok may have changed their response format
4. **Network Issue** - Firewall or network blocking the API call

## Quick Fix:

Delete the stock and add it fresh - this will force a new Grok call on creation.
